**Part 1: How to Use Webstorm, Github, and Git**


**1)** Download Webstorm using https://www.jetbrains.com. Webstorm is an IDE used for coding a variety of different program languages, but in this case, HTML. 


**2)** Register and obtain a licesnse/free trial by following the information provided on the website. 


**3)** Download Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads (the appropriate version, depending on what type of computer you are using)



**4)**  Create a Github account using:https://github.com/join



**5)** Go to webstorm and press 'Ctrl+Alt+S'. You will open up system prefrences. 


**6)** From the menu bar on the left side, choose Version Control and then the Git option underneath that.  



**7)** Here, enter the path that will allow your work on Webstorm to be connected to Git. Click test, and if you have sucessfully connected the two, you will see a success message or, the Git version number. Exit the screen by clicking OK




**8)** To connect to your Github, add the password to Github by clicking CTRL+Alt+S. 






**9)** From here, select Apperance and Behavior--> System Settings--> Passwords. 




**10)** It will ask you for a master password. Create one, to connect your Github to your webstorm. 


**11)**Proceed to Git.



**12)** Sign in 



**13)** Here, on your account page, you will find a green button that says 'create a new repository'. Click this. Ensure that it public, so everyone can access this page.  Your files for your site will be stored within a repository. There will most likely be multiple files. 



**14)** Now, to access that same repository from Webstorm: Click on File-->New-->Project from Vers.Control. In the following menu, fill out the nesscary information.


**15)** To create a file within this, click file--> new--> HTML file.(Or, depending on the file type you require, choose accordingly) You will get the option to add to Git. Click OK. 


**16)** Make some changes on this file. After making changes, it is important that you commit and push these changes to Github, so it can be seen over there, as well. To do this, click the VCS--> Git--> Commit, and then VCS-->Git-->Push

**17)** Check back on Git to ensure that the change can be seen.

**18)** After editing on Webstorm, commit and push every few changes to Github. 


**19)** Once you have finished, to publish, click on your repository 



**20)** Click on settings and scroll to github pages



**21)** Ensure that the source is on 'master branch' and click save.



**22)** Your URL should be saved. 

**PART 2** 
- **Branch**- lives within the repository and allows you to edit without potentially damaging the main brach of code. 

- **Clone** - a copy of the repository that is saved in the computer instead of a server. You can still make changes and still be connected to the original version, so you're able to push any changes. 


-**Commit** - saving your work after updating it, so you can keep track of all the changes made. Each commit has it's own 'name tag' or identifiable tag. 


-**Fetch** - A temporary commit. It allows you to view changes without commiting them. Command written as: git fetch



-**GIT** - A free software used in tracking changes in software/code files collaboratively. It is the 'Google Drive' of code. 


-**GitHub** - An extension of git, used to give access to many open projects. You can either work on an existing project or create your own, in which case you will be able to publish the site through Github, as well. 


-**Merge** - takes the changes in one branch and puts them in another


-**Merge Conflict** - when two different changes are made in the same line of a file. 


-**Push** - sending commited changes from your editor to a remote repository so other people on Github can view them


-**Pull**- merging changes into the local file


-**Remote** - A version of the main repository that can be found on the server 


-**Repository** - the project folder that holds all the files and updates
